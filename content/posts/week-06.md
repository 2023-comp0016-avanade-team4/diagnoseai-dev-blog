When it comes to technology projects, effectively communicating your idea is as important as the technical work itself. This was the challenge we faced in preparing for the Elevator Pitch. Our goal was to create a concise, two-minute presentation that clearly conveyed our project's objectives, outlined the problems we're tackling, and our proposed solution.

# The Preparation

Our preparation for the Elevator Pitch involved distilling complex concepts into clear, concise points. We focused on what mattered most, without delving too deeply into the technical aspects.

Given the tight time limit, our content had to be carefully selected. We included:

- A clear definition of the problem and our approach to solving it
- A brief overview of the user interfaces and explanations on how they will be used
- A snapshot of our intended deliverables together with a (simplified) architecture diagram
- Potential future steps and how the clients can customise the project

Below is the slide deck used for the pitch:

# The Live Presentation

The pitch was online via Zoom, with the module lead and IXN partner present. It was test of our preparation, and the rehearsal process paid off. James delivered our presentation with clarity and confidence, effectively communicating our project's vision and potential.

# Reflections and Moving Forward

This experience taught us valuable lessons in communication. It highlighted the importance of being clear and direct in presenting complex technical projects. The Elevator Pitch was a brief but significant part of our project's journey, providing us with insights that will benefit our development process moving forward.
