This week (Monday was 20 November 2023) first week after the reading week, was primarily focused on gathering and formalizing client requirements and presenting a finalised requirements document to the client. Additionally, time was spent into breaking down the tasks required to develop the Core, Uploader and Web systems.

# Requirements document

Having estimated the time and effort it would require to implement the different features proposed to the client we came up with a formal requirement documents. 

Definitions were established for different features and stakeholders in the project. To avoid any ambiguity in the intepretation of the requirements document. 

Further, the requirements were broken down into functional, non-functional, system and user requirements. In addition, care was taken to distinguish the requirements that the system has to have and those that are optional using the keywords shall and should. 

The aforementioned requirements document can be found via [this link](/diagnoseai-dev-blog/Requirements.pdf)
